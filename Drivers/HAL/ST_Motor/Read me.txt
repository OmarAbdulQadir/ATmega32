Note: All the data in the file is readable, And any editing will affect the controller's behavior.
So It's not recommended to edit any data, Unless you are sure of what is the effect on behaviors.


1. Basic Driver function:
	a. Configure the stepper motor pins.
	b. Move the stepper motor in two directions (CW, CCW) in both modes steps, or angles.
	c. Stop the stepper motor electrically.
	
2. Motor Structure and configurations:
	a. stepper= {port, coil1, coil2, coil3, coil4, mode, step, speed}
		I.    port: The port group that the stepper motor is connected to.
		II.   coil1: The pin that the stepper's coil 1 motor is connected to.
		III.  coil2: The pin that the stepper's coil 2 motor is connected to.
		IV.   coil3: The pin that the stepper's coil 3 motor is connected to.
		V.    coil4: The pin that the stepper's coil 4 motor is connected to.
		VI.   mode: The mode of rotation either its (0 >> Full step single coil), (1 >> Full step Double coil), or (2 >> Half step) and its only effective with steps control mode.
		VII.  step: The current step index in the stepper.
		VIII. speed: The speed prescaler value.

3. List of driver functions:
	I.   void st_mot_void_init(stepper* )
	II.  void st_mot_stop(stepper* )
	III. void st_mot_void_steps_CW(stepper*, u8 )
	IV.  void st_mot_void_steps_CCW(stepper*, u8 )
	V.   void st_mot_void_angles_CW(stepper*, u8 )
	VI.  void st_mot_void_angles_CCW(stepper*, u8 )
