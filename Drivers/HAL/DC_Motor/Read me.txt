Note: All the data in the file is readable, And any editing will affect the controller's behavior.
So It's not recommended to edit any data, Unless you are sure of what is the effect on behaviors.


1. Basic Driver function:
	a. Configure the motor pins.
	b. Move the passed motor in two directions (CW, CCW) in both mode full speed and controled speed mode.
	c. Stop the motor electrically.
	
2. Motor Structure and configurations:
	a. MotorX: {PORT, forward_pin, reverse_pin, speed}
		I.   PORT: port group of the motor pins. Note: motor pins must be connected to the same port group.
		II.  forward_pin, reverse_pin: motor pins numbers. Note if the motor direction is switched its recommended to switch the motor pins.
		III. speed: motor's rotational speed, needed if you are using the controlled speed mode.

3. List of driver functions:
	I.   DC_Motor_void_init(MotorX* )
	II.  DC_motor_void_CW_full_speed(MotorX* )
	III. DC_motor_void_CCW_full_speed(MotorX* )
	IV.  DC_motor_void_stop(MotorX* )
	V.   DC_motor_void_CW(MotorX* )
	VI.  DC_motor_void_CCW(MotorX* )
