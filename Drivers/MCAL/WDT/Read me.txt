Note: All the data in the file is readable, And any editing will affect the controller's behavior.
So It's not recommended to edit any data, Unless you are sure of what is the effect on behaviors.


1. Basic Driver function:
	a. Driver function is to set time of a task and reset if the task time excedded the preset value
	
2. Structs and configurations:
	1. timer values set
		a. time16_3_ms >> Timer value 16.3 ms
		b. time35_5_ms >> Timer value 35.5 ms
		c. time65_0_ms >> Timer value 65.0 ms
		d. time130_ms  >> Timer value 130.0 ms
		e. time260_ms  >> Timer value 260.0 ms
		f. time520_ms  >> Timer value 520.0 ms
		g. time1_0_s   >> Timer value 1.0 s
		h. time2_1_s   >> Timer value 2.1 s

3. List of driver functions:
	I.  void WDT_void_start(u8 )
	II. void WDT_void_stop(void )
